MiniMax-H3 T2VA/FL2VA runner.

Loading strategy (see dev_notes/handoff-minimax-h3.md and diffusers-server CLAUDE.md
#33/#46/#47 for the constraints this follows):

- This box has 96GB VRAM but only ~94GB host RAM. The big components add up to ~144GB
  (text_encoder bf16-native ~66.7GB -- measured on GPU, the checkpoint shards are
  already bf16 -- transformer bf16 ~66.3GB, vae+audio_vae fp32 ~11GB), which fits in
  neither VRAM nor host RAM at once. `ComponentsManager.enable_auto_cpu_offload()`
  keeps every component CPU-resident as its steady state (accelerate hooks only move
  the *active* one to GPU), so it would try to hold all ~144GB in RAM simultaneously --
  not possible here.

There are two loading strategies, selected by the `H3_TE_QUANT` env var:

`H3_TE_QUANT=none`: the two 66GB models cycle through GPU per request, with
  the small fp32 VAEs (~11GB) permanently resident:
    encode phase : [vae 11GB + text_encoder 66GB]   (transformer dropped if resident)
    denoise/decode: [vae 11GB + transformer 66GB]   (TE dropped right after encoding)
  Each drop frees the CUDA model in place (no .to("cpu") staging -- that would take
  ~30s, evict page cache and push the box into swap, observed on the first probe run).
  Reloads are served from disk/page cache at ~16-40s per model, i.e. ~1 load/free cycle
  per generation for each big model -- the "short window" pattern CLAUDE.md sanctions,
  not the banned "swap the whole module every step" pattern. The steady state between
  requests keeps transformer + VAEs resident (77GB). Overhead: ~37s TE reload +
  ~26s transformer reload per request.

`H3_TE_QUANT=bnb-4bit` (default; A/B verified 2026-08-04 -- same-seed frames and audio
  show no visible/audible degradation vs bf16 TE, and requests drop 245s -> 185s):
  the text_encoder is quantized to NF4 (bitsandbytes,
  compute_dtype=bf16) at startup and stays GPU-resident permanently -- bnb 4bit models
  cannot be moved between devices, so "load once, keep forever" is the only option for
  them anyway. Measured size: ~21.0GB (not the ~18GB originally estimated). The
  transformer (66.3GB) also stays resident between requests: no more per-request TE<->
  transformer swap. That leaves transformer+TE-nf4 = ~87.5GB resident during encode/
  denoise, which does not leave enough headroom for vae+audio_vae(11GB, permanently
  resident in the `none` path) plus activation buffers within this card's ~95.6GB. So
  in this mode the VAEs are NOT permanently resident: they live on CPU by default and
  are moved to GPU only for their active phase (keyframe encode / video+audio decode),
  then moved back to CPU right after.
  A second, sharper constraint was found by measurement, not by the original estimate:
  transformer(66.3) + TE-nf4(21.0) + vae pair(11.0) = ~98.5GB *before* any decode
  activation buffer is even counted -- already over the card's ~95.6GB. Keeping all
  three resident through decode OOM'd in practice ("Tried to allocate 30.00 MiB" with
  the allocator already pinned at 93.7GB). Since the transformer is not touched by
  either decode step (MiniMaxH3VideoDecodeStep / MiniMaxH3AudioDecodeStep only use
  vae/audio_vae/video_processor), it is dropped for the ~9s decode window and reloaded
  right after, restoring the transformer+TE-nf4 steady state before the next request.
  None of this is the banned "swap a 60GB+ module every step" pattern (CLAUDE.md #33):
  every move is a single one-way trip bounded to one specific phase (keyframe encode,
  decode, or the reload right after), the same "short window, small object" shape the
  `none` path already uses for its own TE/transformer cycle -- just sliced along a
  different phase boundary (decode instead of encode) and applied to the VAEs plus,
  when decode is the phase in question, the transformer too.
  Overhead avoided: no more per-request TE reload (was ~37s) and no more per-request
  transformer reload *around encode* (was ~26s). Overhead added: ~1 VAE round trip
  in/out of GPU per request (small, fp32, ~11GB, PCIe-bound, no disk I/O) plus one
  transformer drop+reload around the decode window specifically (~10-26s, page-cache
  warm) -- still net faster per request since the TE load is fully eliminated and it
  replaces what used to be *two* full big-model reloads with one.

- video VAE decode runs under a float16 autocast internally (diffusers' own
  MiniMaxH3VideoDecodeStep) even though its weights are float32. audio_vae must stay
  float32 end-to-end: casting it to bf16 is a known upstream bug that makes generated
  audio ~20dB too quiet, so we never touch its dtype after loading fp32.
- The video VAE ships with spatial tiling enabled by default (`use_tiling=True`,
  256px tiles, verified in autoencoder_kl_minimax_h3.py) and runner.py never disables
  it, so tiled decode is already active in both modes -- there is no extra "enable
  tiling" step needed for decode-peak reduction here.

`H3_LOWVRAM=1` (opt-in, default "0" leaves every mode above byte-for-byte unchanged):
  a third loading strategy, orthogonal to `H3_TE_QUANT`/`H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT` (it
  forces TE_QUANT=bnb-4bit's VAE-parks-on-CPU behaviour and requires
  H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8, see H3_LOWVRAM's own module-level comment), for
  48GB-class cards where TE-nf4 (21GB) + transformer-int8 (34GB) = 55GB already does
  not fit together. Steady state between requests is "nothing big resident" (only the
  small VAE pair, parked on CPU). Phase x resident-set table for a t2va request
  (`generate()`'s lowvram branch):

    entry         : [nothing big -- any resident transformer/transformer_ref is freed]
    encode        : [TE-nf4 21GB]                      (transformer freed if resident)
    (TE freed)
    denoise       : [transformer-int8 34GB + ~5GB activations ~= 39GB]  (TE freed)
    (transformer freed)
    decode        : [vae pair ~11GB + decode buffers]  (transformer freed, TE freed)
    (vae parked back on CPU; nothing reloaded "for next time")

  ref2va is the same shape with an extra reference-VAE-encode phase between text-encode
  and denoise (needs `vae` on GPU while TE is *already* freed -- see
  `generate_ref2va()`'s lowvram branch for the `_execution_device` resolution note this
  requires, same "freeing TE makes `vae` the next resolved module, so bring vae onto
  GPU either before or in the same breath as freeing TE" pattern `force_free_te`
  already established for bnb-4bit/int8-both-resident mode above) and denoises against
  `transformer_ref` instead of `transformer`.

  This pays TE-load (~15-40s) + transformer-load (~35-40s, torchao int8 quantization
  happens inline during this load) on *every* request -- there is no cross-request
  steady state to amortize against, unlike every mode above. See README.md for the
  measured per-phase timing breakdown and the peak-VRAM verification against a VRAM
  ballast.

# bias=True)`) with a mathematically-equivalent `nn.functional.linear` on every fresh
# `text_encoder` load. "0" = stock Conv3d, unchanged behaviour (escape hatch).
#
# Why: on this box's sm_120 (Blackwell) GPUs, cuDNN picks a pathologically slow kernel
# for this exact shape -- huge batch dim (num_patches, 28,160 for the profiled
# 768x448/8s ref2va request logged in `_install_qwen3vl_submodule_timing`'s own
# `visual.patch_embed` checkpoint) x tiny spatial extent (2x16x16 = one "patch" worth of
# voxels, matching kernel_size exactly so there is only ever one output position per
# input). This is the identical pathology diffusers-server's CLAUDE.md #46 (JoyAI
# integration) already found and fixed for JoyImageEditPlusTransformer3DModel's
# `img_in` (same class of Conv3d) AND for this exact `Qwen3VLVisionPatchEmbed` in that
# repo's `families/joyai/pipeline.py` (`PatchifyLinear`) -- ~146x speedup there. Isolated
# microbench with THIS process's exact real shapes (`scratchpad/probe_patchify_conv3d.py`,
# run on this box 2026-08-27): Conv3d call = 87-91s *per call* (not a one-time cuDNN
# algo-search cost -- 3 repeated calls at the same shape averaged 90.8s/call), the
# reshape+linear form = 0.0007-0.005s, mean abs diff 6.4e-07 / max abs diff 1.56e-2
# (bf16 rounding-level; consistent with CLAUDE.md #46's own 6.18e-07 for JoyAI).
#
# For `kernel_size == stride` and no padding, a Conv3d degenerates to exactly one output
# position per input window, so `conv(x).view(N, out_ch)` is bit-identical (up to
# floating-point summation order, which bf16 rounds away) to
# `F.linear(x.flatten(1), conv.weight.reshape(out_ch, -1), conv.bias)` -- verified against
# THIS repo's pinned transformers `Qwen3VLVisionPatchEmbed.forward()`
# (`transformers/models/qwen3_vl/modeling_qwen3_vl.py`), which reshapes its input to
# exactly `(-1, in_channels, temporal_patch_size, patch_size, patch_size)` before calling
# `self.proj(...)` -- i.e. batch dim first, no other axis reordering, so `x.flatten(1)`
# on that same 5D tensor lines up with `conv.weight.reshape(out_ch, -1)`'s
# `(in_ch, kt, kh, kw)` -> flat layout with no extra permute needed (this project's
# layout was independently re-derived and confirmed here, not assumed to match JoyAI's
# transformer -- the two use different upstream input tensor orderings in general, but

# and `install_output_capuring_hook`'s `capture_initial_hidden_state` semantics
# (transformers/utils/output_capturing.py): `hidden_states[0]` is the embedding
# output (captured as the hook firing on `layers[0]`'s own *input*, `args[0]`), and
# `hidden_states[k]` for k=1..num_hidden_layers is the *output* of `layers[k-1]` (the
# hook fires as a forward hook on that layer). So `hidden_states[50]` = the output of
# `layers[49]` -- only `layers[0..49]` (50 layers) are ever executed before that value
# is read; everything from `layers[50]` onward, plus the model's final `norm` and the

# place, so truncating `num_hidden_layers` means those layers are literally never

# exactly 50 layers makes `hidden_states[50]` the *last* entry of the captured tuple.
# `Qwen3VLTextModel.forward` is wrapped in `@capture_outputs` (transformers'
# output_capturing.py) with its default `tie_last_hidden_states=True`, which
# unconditionally overwrites the *last* captured hidden_states entry with
# `outputs.last_hidden_state` -- the value AFTER the model's final `self.norm(...)`
# call. In the real 64-layer checkpoint, index 50 is nowhere near the last entry (index
# 64), so this substitution never touches it and `hidden_states[50]` is genuinely the
# raw (pre-norm) output of `layers[49]`, matching what MiniMax-H3 was trained to
# condition on. Truncating to exactly 50 layers makes index 50 the *only* (and thus
# last) entry, silently swapping it for the post-norm value instead -- reproduced by
# this task's own probe (max abs diff ~1.5e4 against the real 64-layer model's
# `hidden_states[50]`, i.e. not quantization noise, a genuinely different number) and
# fixed by keeping one extra layer (51 built, `layers[50]` executes but its output is
# simply never read) so index 50 sits mid-stack again. Verified bit-identical
# (`torch.equal`, both bf16 and bnb-4bit nf4) against the unpruned model's
# `hidden_states[50]` after this fix. This is exactly the failure mode
# `get_qwen3vl_prompt_embeds`'s own guard (`if num_layers <= text_encoder_layer: raise
# ValueError(...)`, see encoders.py -- this used to be `MiniMaxH3TextEncoderStep.
# encode_prompt`'s guard pre-PR#14355, same check, moved to the new module function) was
# written to catch -- pruning to 50 would have raised there; 51 is the smallest value
# that both passes that guard and sidesteps the tie_last_hidden_states substitution.
#
# Applied in `_load_text_encoder()` via `config=` passed straight into
# `load_components()` (same per-component-kwarg dict shape already used for TE's
# `BitsAndBytesConfig`/`device_map`) -- `ComponentSpec.load()` forwards any kwarg that
# is not one of its own loading fields (pretrained_model_name_or_path/subfolder/

#
# 背景: `H3_LOWVRAM=1` の ref2va は毎リクエスト「TE ロード → 参照エンコード → TE 解放 →
# transformer_ref ロード → denoise → transformer_ref 解放 → decode」を回すため、
# denoise 以外に ~43s の固定費がある (うち TE ロード 12.8s + transformer_ref ロード 13.2s)。

# (nf4, prune) は 17.5GB なので、同一GPUへ両方載せたまま回せる見込みがある
# (denoise 活性化 +6.4GB)。このフラグは次の 4 箇所の解放だけを gate する:
#   (1) generate_ref2va() 入口の `_free_transformer_ref()`
#   (2) H3_LOWVRAM 分岐の「参照エンコード後の TE 解放」
#   (3) decode 窓の `_free_transformer_ref()`
#   (4) `H3_KEEP_REF2VA_VAE=1` のときだけ: VAE pair の CPU 退避 (既定 0 = 従来どおり
#       参照エンコード後と decode 後に CPU へ退避。VAE を GPU に置いたままにすると
#       denoise の予算が +5.8GB 増えるため、収支の取れる GPU だけで明示的に使う)
# 上記以外は一切触らない。既定 (H3_KEEP_REF2VA=0) は 1バイトも挙動が変わらない。
#
# 制約と設計判断:
#   - H3_LOWVRAM=1 以外は起動時エラー。LOWVRAM=0 (int8) は元々 transformer_ref+TE を
#     常駐させる設計 (H3_TRANSFORMER_BOTH_RESIDENT)、group は CPU 常駐で別設計のため。
#   - TE を別GPUへ置く構成 (H3_TE_DEVICE) や投影TE (H3_TE_PROJ) でも害はない
#     (`_free_text_encoder` が元々 no-op / 小さい)。KEEP_TRANSFORMER のような
#     「TE 別GPU必須」ガードは要らない: pruned の transformer_ref は 21.6GB で、
#     TE 17.5 + 21.6 = 39.1GB が 48GB 級の予算内に収まるため (KEEP_TRANSFORMER の
#     ガードは TE 17.45 + int8 transformer 34.3 = 51.75GB > 49.8GB が根拠だった)。
#   - **非 pruned** (transformer_ref int8 34.3GB) では TE 17.5 + 34.3 + 活性化 6.4 =
#     58.2GB 必要になり、48GB 級には載らない。起動時に GPU 総容量と突き合わせ、
#     足りなければ RuntimeError、足りるなら (96GB 級) 警告ログのみとする。
#   - VRAM が足りないときは素直に CUDA OOM にする。transformer を丸ごと CPU へ
#     スワップして凌ぐ実装は入れない (diffusers-server CLAUDE.md #33 の事故パターン)。
#   - 他リクエスト (t2va/fl2va/t2i/ref バッチ) は従来どおり `_free_transformer_ref()` で
#     transformer_ref を落とし、TE も force 解放するので、常駐は自然に解消される。
#     次の ref2va が `_load_text_encoder`/`_ensure_transformer_ref` (冪等) で再構築する。
#   - H3_REF_PREFIX_CACHE_SINGLE=1 のプレフィックス KV (~0.84GiB) は TE と寿命を共にする
#     (`_free_text_encoder` で捨てる) ので、TE が常駐するこのモードでは同一参照の
#     リクエスト間で HIT し続ける (VRAM +0.84GiB を常駐させる点に注意)。

# "group" mode's own RAM guard (see H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP's design comment further down):
# the int8 transformer (~34GB) is loaded once and stays resident in host RAM for the
# life of the process (unlike H3_LOWVRAM=1's per-request from-scratch reload) --
# refuse to even attempt that load if host RAM is already tight, rather than silently
# risking the swap-storm/OOM-killer incident CLAUDE.md #33 (this project's sibling
# diffusers-server repo) documents from a past project loading a large module the
# wrong way. Checked once, right before the first group-offload transformer load
# (`_ensure_transformer_group`), not at import time (RAM usage can shift between
# process start and first request).
# 40GB (default) covers the *unpinned* CPU load (~34GB, `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=1`)
# with a thin margin, but the *default* path (`H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=0`, see that
# var's own comment for why it is the default despite the name) eagerly pins the whole
# transformer at `enable_group_offload()` time right after, measured to cost an
# additional ~14-16GB of available RAM on top of the ~32GB the plain CPU load itself
# used (avail_gb dropped 61.0->58.8 during load, then 58.8->45.3 during the pin step, in
# this task's own probe against the real transformer) -- so the *actual* peak
# requirement for the default configuration is closer to ~48GB than 40GB. 40GB is kept
# as the floor (matches this var's literal meaning: do not even start the CPU load
# below this) rather than raised to 48GB by default, since `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=1`
# remains available as an explicit lower-RAM (but slower-denoise) opt-out for boxes
# between 40-48GB of RAM -- raise this explicitly (e.g. to 48) if running the default
# (pinned) configuration on such a box.

# `use_stream=True` overlaps the *next* group's H2D copy with the *current* group's

# verified empirically during this task (scripts/probe_group_offload_forward.py /
# scripts/probe_group_offload_fix.py), not assumed from the diffusers docs:
# `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` (diffusers' own default) skips eagerly pinning
# `cpu_param_dict`'s tensors at `enable_group_offload()` time (`_to_cpu()`,
# hooks/group_offloading.py), deferring pinning to every single onload instead
# (`_pinned_memory_tensors()`, called from `_onload_from_memory()` whenever
# `use_stream=True`). For torchao's `Int8Tensor` (this mode's transformer weight type),
# that deferred pin path is broken: `Int8Tensor.qdata.pin_memory()` raises `RuntimeError:
# cannot pin 'torch.cuda.CharTensor' only dense CPU tensors can be pinned` on every
# single denoise step's block onload -- reproduced first against the real server (a
# t2va request failing inside the FIRST transformer_blocks forward) and then isolated
# down to a minimal dummy int8-quantized nn.Linear stack, confirming
# `use_stream=True + low_cpu_mem_usage=True` is the unconditional trigger (both
# `use_stream=False` and `low_cpu_mem_usage=False` independently avoid it -- see the
# probe scripts' own output for the full traceback and A/B). `low_cpu_mem_usage=False`
# was chosen over `use_stream=False` as this mode's actual default because it also
# measured ~4-5x faster per-block onload against the real transformer (pinned-memory
# H2D copies do not need to wait on a pageable-memory staging copy first): 0.04-0.07s
# vs 0.1-0.26s onload, and offload dropped to ~0s (pinned `cpu_param_dict` tensors are
# reused directly instead of a fresh `.to(cpu)` copy each time). The cost is paid once,
# up front, at `enable_group_offload()` time instead of amortized per-step: pinning the
# full ~34GB int8 transformer took an extra ~22s and reduced available host RAM by
# ~15.7GB in that same measurement (page-locked memory cannot be swapped out, unlike the
# `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` path's plain pageable CPU tensors) -- `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_MIN_RAM_GB`'s
# guard (checked before this load starts) accounts for this. Exposed as an env var
# rather than hardcoded so an operator on a truly RAM-starved box can opt back into the
# slower-but-lower-RAM `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` path if needed -- but note doing so
# still requires `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_USE_STREAM=0` as well (set automatically below,
# since `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` + `use_stream=True` together are exactly the broken
# combination) or the pin_memory() crash returns.

# transformer's `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` under int8 quant; `H3_INT8_MODULES_TO_NOT_CONVERT`
# does not skip them) has no registered `aten.cat` kernel, so `torch.cat([to_q.weight,

# consulted (so this is not the "wrap LoRA before enable_group_offload()" ordering fix
# that helped a sibling project, diffusers-server CLAUDE.md #44 -- reordering cannot fix

# force int8), each failing loudly with a 500 and no VRAM leak or lasting corruption
# (a follow-up plain, non-turbo generation succeeded right after on the same server) --
# rejected below with a loud error rather than silently risking a wrong quantize-then-

#
# turbo=1 + upscale=1 (hires-fix), by contrast, IS verified to work (same task, see

# the transformer is confirmed resident and well before hires-fix's own two-pass split,
# and hires-fix's FBC bookkeeping calls are already no-ops whenever turbo forces
# `effective_cache` to "none".
#

# the default `num_inference_steps` becomes 8 (matches the LoRA author's community-
# verified "8 steps works, 4-7 does not" finding, itself hedged in the README as
# possibly a ComfyUI-sampler artifact rather than a LoRA limit -- this project's own
# verification found no audio breakage even at 4 steps, see README); FirstBlockCache
# (`H3_CACHE=fbc`) is force-disabled regardless of its own env var (a handful of steps
# leaves no redundant-computation window for FBC's residual-similarity skip to safely
# exploit, and caching on top of an already-4-8-step trajectory risks compounding drift
# for no measured benefit); the video/audio schedulers' `shift` is left completely
# untouched (both already default to 12.0/3.0 -- `scheduler_config.json` on disk and
# `MiniMaxH3SetTimestepsStep`'s own docstring both confirm this, and this task's own
# verification found the LoRA author's reference sampler uses the identical two
# constants -- so there is nothing to reconfigure here, unlike a naive port from a

# shape -- no batching, no approximation), so this needs no quality gate, only an
# `ffmpeg framemd5` exact-match check (see docs/h3-adaln-precompute-20260826.md).

# against H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8 and any H3_LOWVRAM mode -- both remain real
# structural conflicts, unrelated to turbo, unchanged from v1:
#
#   - int8: torchao's Int8Tensor-backed `adaln_proj.linear` was not verified against
#     `precompute()`'s own GEMM-per-step + `del`-the-weights shape (the whole point of
#     H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8 is to shrink `adaln_proj` along with everything else
#     via quantization, not to also precompute-and-drop it -- the two techniques target
#     the exact same weights for the exact same reason, combining them is redundant at
#     best and unverified at worst).
#   - H3_LOWVRAM/H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP: both require H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8 already (see
#     that block's own guard above), so this is really the same restriction stated
#     twice for a clearer error message at whichever flag combination an operator
#     actually sets.
#
# turbo is NO LONGER blanket-rejected here (v1's H3_TURBO_LORA check is gone): checked
# key-by-key against every non-comfyui-mirror checkpoint file the default
# H3_TURBO_LORA_REPO (lightx2v/Minimax-h3-Turbo, diffusers-native/DMD format) ships,
# none of them touch `adaln_proj`/`norm_out` at all (0 of 312 wrapped Linears each, see
# core/adaln_precompute.py's module docstring for the full per-file verification) -- so
# there is no structural conflict for that format, and this project's actual
# production config (`H3_TURBO_LORA_FILE=minimax_h3_ref2v_turbo_4step_v0.1_bf16.
# safetensors`, one of the checked files) can run turbo and AdaLN precompute together.
# Only the comfy-format LoRA (`_TURBO_COMFY_REPOS`, e.g. larryvrh/MiniMax-H3-Turbo-Lora)
# genuinely conflicts -- its checkpoint DOES carry an `adaln_proj`/`norm_out` delta (51
# of 259 wrapped Linears, verified against all 3 cached snapshots) -- so THAT specific
# repo is still rejected here, using the same lightweight repo-name heuristic
# `turbo_lora_expected_format()` uses elsewhere in this file (that function is defined
# later in this module and cannot be called yet at this point in module-body
# execution, hence the inline check rather than a call to it). This is a heuristic on
# the *configured* repo, checked again for real by `core/adaln_precompute.py`'s
# `_reject_turbo_wrapped_adaln()` once the actual checkpoint's keys are known (an
# operator could point H3_TURBO_LORA_REPO/H3_TURBO_LORA_FILE at some other,
# not-yet-known comfy-format checkpoint under a different repo name, which this
# heuristic would miss but that later, key-level check would still catch).

    直接 `use_cache=True` で叩く (KVキャッシュ継続には `get_qwen3vl_prompt_embeds` の
    `use_cache=False` 固定呼び出しでは足りないため)。

    設計はプローブをそのまま踏襲する:
      1. `_build_presentation(tokenizer, "", ...)` (プロンプト空文字) のトークン列は、
         任意のプロンプト付きフル系列の先頭と完全一致する (プロンプトは常に最後に

      2. 場面ごとにプロンプト末尾のみを `past_key_values=cache` で継続する。
         `attention_mask`/`mm_token_type_ids`/`pixel_values` 系は全て None
         (`image_grid_thw` を渡すと `model.rope_deltas` が再計算・上書きされる罠がある)
      3. 継続のたびに `DynamicCache.crop(prefix_len)` でプレフィックスに切り戻す (直列運用)

    重要な制約: プレフィックス呼び出しは `model.rope_deltas` (Qwen3VLModel の
    **インスタンス状態**) を書き換え、継続呼び出しはそれを読む。この関数は
    「プレフィックス→全場面の継続」を1回の呼び出し内で完結させるので安全だが、

       で、プレフィックス forward が書き、継続 forward が読む
       (`compute_3d_position_ids`: `past_key_values_length > 0` の枝で
       `position_ids = arange(past_len, past_len+seq) + self.rope_deltas`)。バッチ版は
       「プレフィックス→全継続」を1呼び出しで閉じるので放置できたが、リクエストを
       またぐと間に t2va のプロンプトエンコードや `/api/prompt/enhance` が挟まって
       `rope_deltas` が上書きされうる。そこでプレフィックス時の値を clone して持ち、
       **継続の直前に必ず書き戻す**。これで間に何が挟まっても継続は同じ位置IDで走る。
    2. **text_encoder の同一性チェック**。KV は特定の TE インスタンスの重みで作った
       ものなので、TE が解放/再ロード/量子化変更されたら無効。`weakref` で保持して
       「今の `components.text_encoder` と同一オブジェクトか」を毎回見る
       (`_free_text_encoder()` 側でも能動的に捨てている -- 二重の安全側)。

    PR #14355 (f37ab93) deleted `packing.py`, which used to export this as
    `unpatchify_video_tokens` -- there is no replacement upstream at all (the equivalent

    decoders.py, as part of unpacking a *denoised* sequence back into `latents`/
    `audio_latents`, not exposed as a standalone function). This project's own policy is
    to bring back a small self-implementation rather than vendor a private diffusers
    module (see the "自前実装を好む" project note), so this is a verbatim port of this
    repo's own copy of the pre-PR#14355 `packing.unpatchify_video_tokens` -- confirmed
    byte-for-byte identical to the reshape/permute `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep.__call__`
    performs on its own `latents` rows (decoders.py), which is the ground truth this port
    is checked against.

    estimate as a 5D tensor mid-loop -- before the real `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep` ever

    graph pins ~50GB of TE weights on GPU past the free that follows).

    PR #14355 (f37ab93) removed `encode_prompt` entirely -- there is no longer a single

    across two block `__call__` methods (`MiniMaxH3TextEncoderStep` for t2va,
    `MiniMaxH3FL2VATextEncoderStep` for fl2va, both in encoders.py) built on top of the
    new `get_qwen3vl_prompt_embeds` module function, which itself only takes an
    already-tokenized presentation (`token_ids`/`vision_inputs`), not a prompt string.
    This function ports the presentation-building half of both `__call__` methods back
    into one place (read line-for-line from encoders.py as part of this migration; the
    tokenization shape -- `"<Picture i>: "` label + vision block per keyframe, prompt
    verbatim, no chat template, no special tokens -- is unchanged from the old
    `encode_prompt`), then calls `get_qwen3vl_prompt_embeds` for the actual conditioner

            `tokenizer`/`processor` are read off it, matching every other call site in
            this file's own naming (`components` is what the modular blocks call this
            argument too).
        prompt (`str`): The prompt to encode.

    run-time low-rank delta (see `_TurboLoRALinear`), wrapping every Linear the checkpoint
    adapts (see `_turbo_lora_key_map`'s docstring for the full derivation).

    Fuses every `MiniMaxH3Attention` submodule's Q/K/V projections into `to_qkv` first
    (`attn.fuse_projections()`, a diffusers-native, weight-preserving op -- see
    `AttentionModuleMixin.fuse_projections`) since the checkpoint's `qkv_proj` LoRA targets
    the fused projection, not the three separate ones diffusers builds by default. This is
    required for the LoRA's `attn.qkv_proj` delta to land on the same activation the
    checkpoint's own training run saw; diffusers' unfused `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` triple has no
    single matching Linear for a fused-QKV LoRA to attach to.

    IMPORTANT (found by this task's own verification, not assumed from the diffusers
    docstring): `fuse_projections()` COPIES `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v`'s weights into a new
    `to_qkv` Linear but does NOT delete the three originals (`unfuse_projections()` is the
    only place that ever removes an attribute, and it only ever removes `to_qkv`, never
    puts `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` back -- read in `diffusers/models/attention.py`). Left alone,
    this leaves every attention module holding BOTH the fused and unfused weights at once
    -- reproduced on this task's first server-integration attempt: the transformer's own
    resident size grew from the expected ~66.3GB to 79.08GB after this function ran (an
    extra ~12.8GB, consistent with Q+K+V's combined size roughly matching to_qkv's), which
    then OOM'd the very next component load (TE-nf4, ~21GB) with the card almost full.
    `del module.to_q / to_k / to_v` right after fusing reclaims that duplicate memory --
    safe because `to_qkv`'s weight is an independent concatenated copy (`torch.cat(...)`
    inside `fuse_projections()`, not a view), not an alias into the three originals.

    Idempotent is NOT guaranteed by design: this is meant to run exactly once, right after
    a fresh (un-adapted) transformer load -- see the `H3_TURBO_LORA` module comment and its
    call site in `_ensure_transformer`. Calling it twice on the same module would wrap an
    already-`_TurboLoRALinear`-wrapped module a second time (harmless numerically -- the
    LoRA delta would just apply twice -- but wasteful and not the intended usage) and the
    second `fuse_projections()` call would be a no-op (`fused_projections` is already True).

    Returns the number of Linear layers wrapped (259 for this checkpoint: 50 blocks x 5 +
    2 token_refiner blocks x 4 + 1 final_layer, see `_turbo_lora_key_map`'s docstring),
    which the caller logs and can sanity-check against the checkpoint's own key count.

        """`H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP` ("group" mode) transformer loading: CPU-resident int8 +
        diffusers block-level group offload, for 24-32GB-class cards.

        Unlike every other mode in this file (including `H3_LOWVRAM=1`, which frees the
        transformer completely between requests), this mode's transformer is loaded
        *once* and stays resident -- in host RAM, not VRAM -- for the life of the
        process, exactly like `bnb-4bit` TE's own "load once, keep forever" shape (see
        `_load_text_encoder`'s docstring: bnb 4bit modules cannot be `.to()`-moved
        between devices either, so reload-from-scratch is the only alternative there;
        here it is simply unnecessary, since a group-offloaded module's GPU visits are
        already small and self-managed by diffusers' own hooks).

        Design, verified against this file's actual constraints by
        `scripts/probe_group_offload.py` before being wired in here (see that script's
        own docstring and this task's write-up for the full reasoning):

        1. `device_map={"transformer": "cpu"}` + `TorchAoConfig(Int8WeightOnlyConfig)`.
           A plain string device_map value becomes `{"": torch.device("cpu")}` inside
           `from_pretrained` (see `modeling_utils.py`'s device_map normalization) -- a
           single-entry dict whose *value* is a `torch.device` object, not the string
           `"cpu"`. `TorchAoHfQuantizer.validate_environment` only sets its
           offload-skip-quantize flag (`self.offload = True`, which makes
           `check_if_quantized_param` skip quantizing anything placed on `"cpu"`) when
           `"cpu" in device_map.values()` -- a `torch.device("cpu") == "cpu"` comparison
           is `False` in Python, so that flag is never set here and every eligible
           linear layer DOES get quantized to torchao's `Int8Tensor`, even though every
           weight lands on CPU. Confirmed empirically: probe scan found 370/370 eligible
           linear layers as `Int8Tensor` (none fell back to plain bf16 `Tensor`), and RAM
           dropped by ~32GB during the load (consistent with the already-measured ~34GB
           int8 size measured on GPU in `H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8` mode).
        2. `enable_group_offload(onload_device=cuda, offload_device=cpu,
           offload_type="block_level", num_blocks_per_group=1, use_stream=True,
           low_cpu_mem_usage=H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM)` -- the CPU-then-offload
           ordering (module loaded CPU-side *first*, group offloading layered on top
           after) is the same shape diffusers-server's sibling project (CLAUDE.md
           #33/#34/#37) already established as correct: the hooks are in place before
           anything ever tries to move the whole ~34GB module onto GPU at once (which is
           the failure mode "block-level group offload" exists to avoid in the first
           place). 50 transformer_blocks at ~0.68GB (int8) each means
           `num_blocks_per_group=1` with `use_stream=True`'s double-buffered prefetch
           keeps only ~1-2 blocks (~1.4GB) GPU-resident at any moment during denoise, not
           the full 34GB. `low_cpu_mem_usage` defaults to `False` here -- see
           `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM`'s own module-level comment for why: diffusers'
           own default (`True`) combined with `use_stream=True` hits a real bug for
           torchao's `Int8Tensor` (`RuntimeError: cannot pin 'torch.cuda.CharTensor'
           only dense CPU tensors can be pinned`, reproduced against both a minimal
           dummy int8 stack and the real transformer, isolated to exactly this
           combination), and the fix (`low_cpu_mem_usage=False`, which eagerly pins
           `cpu_param_dict` once at this call instead of once per onload) also measured
           ~4-5x faster per-block onload as a side benefit.
        3. FBC (`H3_CACHE=fbc`) and the attention backend (`H3_ATTN_BACKEND=sage`) are
           applied exactly as in every other mode: both are independent hook layers
           (FBC decides whether to skip a block's compute at all; group offloading
           decides whether that block's weights are already GPU-resident; the attention
           backend only changes what happens inside a block's own attention call once it
           does run) -- diffusers' `HookRegistry` supports multiple hooks per module by
           design (see `hooks/hooks.py`), and this is exactly what the task's own
           empirical verification (this run) is checking end-to-end, not just asserting.

        No RAM-vs-VRAM cycling for the transformer itself is needed once this call
        returns -- `_free_transformer`/decode-window drops elsewhere in this file are
        skipped for `H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP` (see the `generate()`/`generate_ref2va()` call
        sites), since group offloading already keeps VRAM usage low without a full
        drop+reload.

        turbo-distilled checkpoint needs has to follow it per-request too, not get
        fixed at process start the way `H3_VIDEO_SHIFT` alone would.

        No-op entirely when `H3_TURBO_VIDEO_SHIFT` (module-level, resolved from either
        the env var or the configured turbo LoRA file's name -- see its own module
        comment) is `None`: this happens for every LoRA file that is not an fl2v
        `_768p` variant (fl2v non-768p, and all ref2v files including the `_768p`-named
        ref2v 8step v1.0), which were all distilled at the same shift the base model
        already defaults to, so there is nothing to switch between turbo=1 and turbo=0.
        Also effectively unreachable when `H3_TURBO_LORA=0` (LoRA disabled for this
        process): callers only invoke this after `settings.resolve_instant_settings()`,
        and `turbo_effective` can only be True if `H3_TURBO_LORA=1` unless a request
        explicitly opts in via `turbo=True` -- but the request-level override is itself
        rejected before reaching a transformer that never got the turbo LoRA structurally

        checks). Must run before the request's `MiniMaxH3SetTimestepsStep` call(s) --

        12.0/audio 3.0 is the shared baseline, and the 768p checkpoint's own upstream

        # *separate* shell object, so it held its own strong reference to the same

        # `self._pipe_ref` a plain alias for `self._pipe` (`_ensure_pipe_ref_shell`'s

        **なぜ生成ロック解放後に decode して安全か** (`H3_DECODE_STREAM=1` のとき):
          1. この時点で transformer の仕事は終わっており、残りの入力は latent 2本だけ。
             以降 decode が触るのは VAE の重みと自分の中間テンソルだけで、`state` /
             scheduler / transformer / TE / KV キャッシュには一切触れない。
          2. VAE モジュールはステートレス (`autoencoder_kl_minimax_h3.py` に feature cache 等の
             インスタンス状態なし。tiling フラグは常に True のまま誰も書き換えない)。次の
             リクエストの参照エンコード (同じ video VAE の encode) と同じ重みを読むだけ。

             (`decode_deferred_active` がこの構成を成立条件にしている)。
          3. torch の current stream / autocast / no_grad はスレッドローカル。`=1` では
             デフォルト (legacy) ストリームに両スレッドの演算が投入され、GPU 上では投入順に
             処理される (カーネルの真の同時実行は無いが、飢餓も起きない)。`=2` は専用ストリーム
             (PyTorch の side stream は non-blocking) で真に重なるが、sage attention 等
             「current stream を尊重しないカーネル」が共有 VAE に混ざると壊れるため、native
             attention に固定した decode 専用コピーを使う (`_ensure_decode_vaes`)。
          4. 入力 latent は denoise と同じスレッドで `synchronize` 済み、decode 完了
             (`.cpu()` で同期) まで本スレッドが保持するので、use-after-free は起きない。
          5. decode 同士は `_decode_lock` で直列化 (次々リクエストの decode が重なって VRAM を
             二重に積まない)。mux はロック外 (CPU のみ)。
          6. 注意: 重なっている間は (a) `torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats()` を次リクエストが

    def _upscale_block_state_2x(self, components, block_state, state, pass1_steps: int, last_step_info: dict):
        """Spatially upscale the video latent of `block_state` 2x between pass 1 and pass 2
        of hires-fix, and rebuild the packed-sequence layout (row_timestep_plan, position_ids,
        token_tags, video/audio/text_indices) for the new resolution's *remaining* timesteps.

        IMPORTANT (found during this task's own verification, not assumed from the reference
        up front): this upscales the pass-1 **x0 estimate** (the model's denoised prediction),
        not the noisy `x_t` sample directly, then re-noises the upscaled x0 at the pass-2
        starting sigma with fresh noise. The first implementation bilinear-interpolated
        `block_state.latents` (the noisy `x_t`) directly, matching a naive reading of "spatial
        2x upscale of the video latent between passes" -- this reliably produced a checkerboard/
        moire-corrupted decode (reproduced and isolated with `scripts/debug_vae_direct.py`:
        the corruption persists even with `vae.disable_tiling()`, so it is not a VAE tiling-seam
        artifact, and it is present in a *direct* decode of the interpolated latent with zero
        pass-2 steps run, so it is not something pass 2 could ever "clean up" -- if anything pass
        2 amplifies it into total noise because the model is being asked to denoise a `x_t` whose
        noise component has been low-pass-filtered by the bilinear resize, which is off-distribution
        for what the model expects a genuine forward-process sample to look like at that sigma).
        Re-reading the ComfyUI reference's own description in light of this (`utils.py`, fetched
        during this task): its pass 1 is read from `SamplerCustomAdvanced`'s `denoised_output`
        (already the x0 estimate, not the noisy latent) and its upscale node explicitly re-noises
        via `model_sampling.noise_scaling(sigma_start, fresh_noise, upscaled_latent)` afterward --
        i.e. the reference *never* interpolates a noisy sample either. This implementation follows
        that shape once translated to this scheduler's own `scale_noise(sample, timestep, noise)`
        API (`x_t = t*x0 + (1-t)*noise`, this repo's rectified-flow convention, see
        scheduling_minimax_h3.py): x0 is reconstructed here from the last pass-1 step's
        `(sample, model_output, t)` via the same formula `MiniMaxH3Scheduler.step()` uses
        internally (`denoised = sample + (1-t)*model_output`) since the block wrapper discards
        it, that x0 is what gets bilinear-interpolated, and the result is re-noised with **fresh**
        noise at pass 2's first timestep before pass 2's loop begins.

        Only the *video* rows have spatial extent (`(t, h, w)` -> `F.interpolate`); the audio
        rows are channel-major and carry no height/width coordinate at all (see
        `build_packed_sequence` in packing.py -- their rotary position only has a time axis
        and a fixed left/right width-grid endpoint pin), so they are left completely
        untouched here, matching the reference ComfyUI node's audio pass-through
        (`audio_denoise=0` behaviour) -- this task's design choice per the brief.

        This function assumes `num_condition_video_rows == 0` / `num_condition_audio_rows
        == 0` (t2va only, no keyframe conditioning rows) -- enforced by the `ValueError`
        `generate()` raises for fl2va + upscale before this is ever reached.

        PR #14355 (f37ab93) note: `packing.py` is gone. `patchify_video_latents` survives
        as a plain module function in before_denoise.py (imported below, unchanged
        signature/behaviour). `build_packed_sequence` and `build_row_timesteps` moved onto
        their respective step classes as `@staticmethod`s and both grew new required
        arguments (`audio_channels`/`audio_tag`/`video_tag` for the former, an explicit
        `video_indices`/`audio_indices`/... row-index shape for the latter, replacing the
        old `MiniMaxH3PackedSequence` namedtuple-style return with a plain positional
        tuple) -- both call sites below are updated for the new signatures.
        `unpatchify_video_tokens` has **no replacement upstream at all** (deliberately, per
        this project's "prefer self-implementation over vendoring" policy) -- it is ported
        verbatim below as a private module-level helper (`_unpatchify_video_tokens`),
        copied from this repo's own vendored copy of the pre-PR#14355 packing.py (the
        algorithm is also, byte-for-byte, what `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep.__call__` now
        inlines in decoders.py -- confirmed by reading both).

        # with room to spare (28.67GB peak, see README). H3_TE_PRUNE shrinks TE to
        # ~17.45GB, which sounded like it should only make this mode's headroom bigger,

        # (17.45GB) + the group-offloaded transformer's own resident blocks + denoise
        # activations still leaves only ~2GB of slack at a 24GB budget, and reproducibly
        # OOMs 1 step into denoise ("Tried to allocate 1.16 GiB" with 23.12GB already in
        # use against a 24GB ballast). Pruning alone was not enough to cross the 24GB
        # line this mode's docs already draw at 32GB -- so H3_TE_PRUNE=1 additionally
        # borrows H3_LOWVRAM=1's own choreography (force-free TE for the denoise loop,
        # reload it after) for this mode specifically, verified by this task's own
        # 24GB-ballast retest to fix the OOM (see H3_TE_PRUNE's own module comment for
        # the full measurement table). Unpruned H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP (H3_TE_PRUNE=0, the

        `generate(still=True)` を N 回呼ぶと毎回 TE ロード(~75-97s) + transformer
        ロード(~35-40s)を払う(lowvram=1 は「リクエスト間は何も常駐させない」設計の
        ため)。この関数は同じ choreography を **位相順** に並べ替える:

            entry   : [nothing big resident]

            (transformer freed)
            decode  : [vae pair]   全場面を順にデコード → PNG/mp4 保存
            (vae parked; 何も再ロードしない = lowvram=1 の定常状態そのまま)

        各位相の常駐セットは generate() の lowvram 分岐と同一なので、VRAM 予算は
        1枚生成と変わらない(場面ごとに増えるのは潜在とprompt_embedsのみ。22フレームの
        潜在は2フレーム相当で場面あたり数十MB)。実測の狙い: ~157s/枚 → ~35-40s/枚。

        場面間で共有される可変状態のリセット(このタスクで確認した2点):
        - スケジューラ: sigmas/timesteps の**値**は全場面で同一(同じ幾何・ステップ数)
          なので、encode 位相で場面ごとに timesteps_step を回した後は、デノイズ直前に
          `_step_index = None` に戻すだけでよい(`MiniMaxH3Scheduler.step()` は
          `_step_index is None` のとき timestep 値から index を再導出する --
          scheduling_minimax_h3.py L262-263 で確認)。video/audio 両方に適用
        - FirstBlockCache: generate() と同じく場面ごとに `_reset_stateful_cache()` +
          `cache_context("h3")`(前の場面の残差で新しい場面の step 0 が誤スキップ
          しないように)

        seed は全場面共通(= 手動で同一 seed を N 回叩くのと同じ挙動。場面ごとの
        再現性がバッチの構成に依存しない)。decode 位相は場面ごとに PNG/mp4 を保存
        しながら進むので、途中で失敗しても完了済み場面のファイルは outputs/ に残る

        Runs ref2va: joint video+audio generation conditioned on an ordered list of

        instances (up to 9/3/3, 12 total).

        `still=True` は参照付き静止画モード (ref2i): `seconds` を無視して `still_frames`
        (STILL_FRAME_CHOICES) の超短尺を生成し、中央フレームを PNG に書き出す。
        キャラクター参照から場面ごとの一貫した静止画を作る用途
        (2026-08-07 のスパイク `scripts/probe_ref2va_short.py` で品質成立を実証済み。
        README「スパイク: Ref2VA×超短尺」参照)。generate() の still と同じ3点セット
        (setup step の間だけの尺ゲート緩和・VAE 小クリップ修正・既存の decode 例外
        クリーンアップ) で動く。

        `seconds=None` is only valid when `references` carries exactly one audio-bearing
        reference (a lone audio reference, or a video reference with a soundtrack) -- the
        generated duration is then that reference's own, per
        `MiniMaxH3Ref2VASetupStep.__call__`. `height`/`width` default to MiniMax-H3's own
        16:9 canvas when left out (references never bind the target geometry -- each is
        prepared at its own resolution, see references.py's module docstring).

        Mirrors `generate()`'s structure closely (same FBC instrumentation, same
        bnb-4bit-mode decode-window transformer drop/reload pattern), but against
        `self._pipe_ref` / `transformer_ref` and the ref2va block set. Does not support
        `upscale` (hires-fix) -- out of scope for this task, and `_upscale_block_state_2x`
        assumes t2va's `num_condition_video_rows == 0`, which is never true here (a
        reference always adds condition rows).

        `cache`/`cache_threshold`/`attn`/`turbo`: same instant-apply overrides as
        `generate()` (see core/settings.py), applied to `transformer_ref` instead of
        `transformer`. `upscale` is not a parameter here at all (see above), so there is
        no upscale-vs-turbo interaction to validate on this path.

        `vocal_lock`: per-request override of the module-level `H3_VOCAL_LOCK` env-var
        default (`None` = use the env var, unchanged behavior). See that constant's
        module comment and `_build_vocal_lock_latents()`'s docstring for what it does.

        Returns a dict with mp4_path, frame counts, timing and VRAM/RAM stats, in the
        same shape `generate()` returns (plus `references_summary`).

        PR #14355 (f37ab93) migration note: `self._pipe_ref` is now just an alias for
        `self._pipe` (see `_ensure_pipe_ref_shell`'s docstring) -- there is only ONE
        ModularPipeline shell, whose `_component_specs` already carries `transformer_ref`
        alongside `transformer`. `MiniMaxH3Ref2VACoreDenoiseStep`'s own block order
        (modular_blocks_minimax_h3.py) is `prepare_layout, prepare_condition_latents,
        prepare_latents, prepare_latents_ref2va, set_timesteps, denoise, after_denoise` --
        this method follows that order exactly (see `generate()`'s own fl2va comment on
        why `MiniMaxH3PrepareConditionLatentsStep` must run *before*
        `MiniMaxH3PrepareLatentsStep`, and `MiniMaxH3Ref2VAPrepareLatentsStep` after: the
        draw order is part of what the request's generator reproduces).
        `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep` (unpatchify) is inserted right before decode, same as
        `generate()`'s own t2va/fl2va path.
